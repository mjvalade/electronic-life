I read and reread both chapters many times but couldn't get the exercises started. Last night Lovisa and I spent an hour and half going over prototypes and functions. That helped make some things more clear for me.

Sometimes I feel like I have such a hard time starting the exercises but I need to tell myself to just start typing stuff and work it out.
